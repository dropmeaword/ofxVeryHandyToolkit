The ofxVeryHandyToolkit
is made in Amsterdam by Luis Rodil-Fernandez

This is a collection of openFrameworks addons that I have been building along a few openFrameworks projects.

This has been used in interactive installations such as ikStaar and FriendSlicer.

<h2>MODE D'EMPLOI</h2>
. Get latest version from github at https://github.com/dropmeaword/ofxVeryHandyToolkit
. Add the ofxVeryHandyToolkit in to your OF installation under the addons directory
. Include it in your project as you would any other addon
. Delete the example directory as to not conflict with your own main OF loop
